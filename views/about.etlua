<h1>A Breif History</h1>
<p>DailyMath came about because I really wanted to do some math problems after graduating college. I originally wanted a math problem published everyday in a newspaper, but realized I didn't have any way of getting it published. Not to mention that I am currently not subscribed to any newspapers :P So, I made a webapp and here we are!</p>
