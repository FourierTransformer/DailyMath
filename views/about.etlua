<p>dailyMath came about because I really wanted to do some math problems after graduating high school/college. I originally wanted it to be a math problem published in a newspaper, but realized that would quickly fall apart as I don't have any way of publishing any such thing in a newspaper. Not to mention that I am currently not subscribed to any newspapers :P I realized - hey, I can turn this into a webapp and then dailyMath was born!</p>
